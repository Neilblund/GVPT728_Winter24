# Data

Use the code below to download replication data for [Sørensen, Rune J. "The impact of state television on voter turnout." *British Journal of Political Science* 49.1 (2019): 257-278.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QGMHHQ) 

Note that, for the purposes of this analysis, you will be using only data from 1963 (the paper itself does something far more interesting, but we'll save it for later!)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

turnout_data<- dataverse::get_dataframe_by_name(
  filename = 'AggregateReplicationTVData.dta',
  .f = haven::read_dta,
  dataset = '10.7910/DVN/QGMHHQ', 
  server = "dataverse.harvard.edu")

# filtering for 1963 ONLY 
turnout_data<-turnout_data|>
  filter(nationalelection==0)|>
  filter(year == 1963)|>
  mutate(CountyId = factor(CountyId),
         knr = factor(knr)
         )
```

Each row of `turnout_data` contains information on a single municipality. The variables of interest for this analysis are as follows:

| Variable | Description |
|----|----|
| turnout | \% turnout |
| TVdummy | Does this municipality have television access yet? (**This is the main explanatory variable of interest**) |
| logpop | Log of municipality population |
| education | Share of adult population with college education |
| settlement | \% of population that lives in sparsely populated area |
| voterpct | \% of the population that is eligible to vote |
| CountyId | County ID (numeric converted to factor) |
| knr | Municipality ID (number converted to factor) |

You'll use the following baseline model:

```{r}

model0<-lm(turnout ~ TVdummy + logpop + education + settlement + voterpct, data=turnout_data)
```

## Question 1

Estimate 3 new versions of `model0` that account for correlations across levels of `CountyId`:

1.  A model with cluster robust standard errors
2.  A fixed effects model
3.  A random effects model

Include your output in a formatted regression table and briefly discuss the differences between your results.

```{r}
### Q1 code



```

## Question 2

Which of the models above seems like a better approach for this analysis? Briefly discuss some pros and cons for each one.
