Using the data set you created in HW 1: create a regression model to explain/predict the Democratic vote share in 2020.

Some courses you might use are:

-   [Tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/)

-   [Correlates of State Policy](https://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy)

-   [2020 Election context from the MIT Election and Data Science Lab](https://github.com/MEDSL/election_night2020/tree/main/context)

Provide descriptive statistics, regression results and diagnostics, and make a case for why your model is a good one.

P.S.: you are welcome to analyze a different data set if you're interested in a different topic, the goal here is just to try some model diagnostics and comparisons
